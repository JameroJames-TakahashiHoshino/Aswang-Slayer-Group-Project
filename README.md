Aswang Slayer Group Project

This project is a 2D platformer game built in Java, inspired by Filipino mythology and folklore. It features hand-drawn pixel art, animated characters, and classic platformer mechanics. This game was created as a group project, and it represents our first experience uploading a large multi-folder project to GitHub.

🎮 About the Game

Aswang Slayer follows Pedro Penduko, the main protagonist, on a mission to battle iconic Filipino mythological creatures. In this early version, the game includes:

Sigbin – a fast and sneaky folklore creature

Tikbalang – tall, horse-headed forest guardian

Duwende – small but mischievous earth-dwelling beings

The game is built using Java, with custom sprite animation and structured object-oriented programming (OOP) design.

🎨 Art & Animation

This project uses:

Aseprite for creating pixel-art characters, backgrounds, and effects

Studio Smack (or Studio S.M.A.C.K) for animating sprite sequences, blending frames, and polishing visual movement

Every character sprite was drawn manually and animated frame by frame.

🧩 Project Structure

The main folders in this repository include:

src/ – All Java source code for game logic

res/ – Images, sprites, and audio resources

bin/ – Compiled Java bytecode

AswangSlayer_2d_Platformer_Game/ – Container folder from the original project setup

Some folders may be from our early attempts and may not be functional, but the overall project runs successfully.

📜 Notes

This was our first major upload involving large file structures.

Some folders may not run but are kept for project history.

The game builds and runs from the primary src/ directory.

👥 Group Contribution

This project was created collaboratively, with members contributing to coding, character design, and pixel animation.
